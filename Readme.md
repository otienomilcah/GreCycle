## Problem Research
* EPA(Environmental Protection Agency) says that of 75% of total waste stream only 30% is actually being recycled.This figure is only 13% globally.

### So what is the Problem ?
* The biggest challenge faced by recycling Industry comes with Poor Recycling Quality * Due to Lack of Education. Non-recyclable materials being put in the recycling stream (such as liquids or plastic bags) that contaminate recyclable materials. However, recycling the wrong items can actually do more harm than good

## Solution Identification
* As a solution to the problem we thought of developing an App
* That increases the knowledge of an individual as in what items are recyclable and what not .
* And a solution to encourage individuals to recycle 


## Solution Implementation
* Project Features
* The app includes feature to reach out to nearby recyclers, as well as view all other recyclers registered at the app
* A features to gain knowledge about recyclable products 
* The app also has a feature of Pick up/Drop off option. The user can either choose to drop off the waste at the Recycling centres themselves or can opt for the pick up,   for which they will be charged a small amount as pick up charges.
* Upon choosing to drop off, users will be granted with a OTP or barcode, which they can provide at the centre to complete the process.


### Why would the people recycle?

* The user would earn points on recycling, which they can then use to claim vouchers that eventually would motivate them to recycle more.
